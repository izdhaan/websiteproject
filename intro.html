<h1>Greetings</h1>
<hr>



<p>My name is Izdhaan.I am 16 years old.</p>



<p>
I was born may 11 2006.I love to watch movies and always talk to my friends at all times.My favourite colors are green. <br>
Nowadays i am editing videos or making digital art and share them with my friends to make me feel proud of myself. <br>
At weekends, I visit to my grandparents who currently lives at Hulhumale' Phase 2. <br>
I got interested in technology when i started learning about it. <br>
Back in 2015, I learned about games and thought of starting a career from it. <br>
In 2018,I played in an international tournament for the first time ever and got second place <br>
Before I finish, i want to thank Maldives Ports Limited (MPL) for giving me an opportunity to learn new and beneficial things like coding <br>
Special thanks for Adam from MPL for the help that he has given me. <br>
